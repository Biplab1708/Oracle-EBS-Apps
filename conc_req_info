Check the Running Concurrent request status 
However, you can add more columns from gv$session/fnd_concrruent_processes tables as per your requirement

SELECT distinct a.request_id,d.sid,d.serial#, d.inst_id, d.osuser,d.process, d.sql_id,d.status
FROM apps.fnd_concurrent_requests a,
apps.fnd_concurrent_processes b, gv$process c, gv$session d
WHERE a.controlling_manager = b.concurrent_process_id
AND c.pid = b.oracle_process_id
AND b.session_id=d.audsid
AND a.request_id = 740630048       
AND a.phase_code = 'R'
order by 2;
